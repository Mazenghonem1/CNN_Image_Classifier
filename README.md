# CNN Image Classifier

This repository contains my first neural network project where I implement and compare an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of the following 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The project explores two different neural network architectures (ANN and CNN) to achieve this task.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/CNN_Image_Classifier.git
   cd CNN_Image_Classifier
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization, use the following commands:

Data Preprocessing:

bash

python data_preprocessing.py
Train and Evaluate the ANN Model:

bash

python ann_model.py
Train and Evaluate the CNN Model:

bash

python cnn_model.py
Visualizations:

bash

python visualizations.py
Results
Here are some key results from the project:

ANN Model
Accuracy: (Include your accuracy result here)
Confusion Matrix: (Include the confusion matrix plot here)
CNN Model
Accuracy: (Include your accuracy result here)
Confusion Matrix: (Include the confusion matrix plot here)
The CNN model outperforms the ANN model in terms of accuracy and generalization.

Future Work
Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters.
Perform more detailed error analysis to identify common misclassifications.
Explore transfer learning using pre-trained models.
